## Problem NP = P

Algorithm complexity : algorithm's operation quantity to solve the problem  

Class P  : low algorithm complexity | easy to verify the solution  
Class NP : high algorithm complexity | easy to verify the solution

### Ordering a list

It is easier to verify that a list is sorted than to sort a list : 





For example, for a Sudoku problem, the verification is 

### Backpack problem

To solve, we can use the brut force, but there are 2<sup>N</sup>
