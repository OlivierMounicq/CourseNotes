## Problem NP = P

Algorithm complexity : algorithm's operation quantity to solve the problem  

Class P  : low algorithm complexity | easy to verify the solution  
Class NP : high algorithm complexity | easy to verify the solution

### Ordering a list

It is easier to verify that a list is sorted than to sort a list : 





For example, for a Sudoku problem, the verification is 

### Knapsack problem

_Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible_

[Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)

To solve, we can use the brut force, but there are 2<sup>N</sup>  

10 objects : 1024 combinations 
20 objects : about 1 million combinations  
60 objects :  
300 objects :  

Exponential complexity : 2<sup>N</sup>  

But the solution verification is easy !  

- Find a solution : exponential complexity  
- Verify the solution : linear complexity  

### Prime factor  

Example:  
- 30 = 3 x 2 x5  
- 10241 = 7 x 7 x 11 x 19  
- 56475871 = 7247 x 7793  

We use
